# Delivery-time-prediction-using-Machine-learning
Conducted comprehensive exploratory analysis on historical data, encompassing data preprocessing, visualization, and model development. Employed various models, including Linear, k-NN, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest Regression, with Random Forest Regression achieving the highest accuracy at 89%. 
Food delivery apps have been generating millions of revenue over the last decade, The pandemic-propelled sector is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years. Online ordering and delivery have expanded 300 percent faster than dine-in visitation since 2014.So to improve the service provided by the sector is crucial for the betterment of the field. The following work aims to predict the time taken for food delivery considering various parameters that affects the process. We have used various machine learning algorithms for the predictions of time taken to deliver the ordered food.
The data set used for this study contains the feature like type of  order, type of vehicle, condition of vehicle, festival season(y/n),multiple delivery(y/n),weather condition, road traffic intensity, city.These are all the independent variable considerterd in order to predict the target variable -Time taken.
KEY WORDS:  Prediction, Machine learning,
